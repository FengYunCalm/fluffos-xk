/*
 * Source-file extension spelling resolution (#1247 TESTS, single owner).
 *
 * Three callers share this rule: load_object (simulate.cc), the recompiler
 * (compile_program_for_recompile, recompile.cc) and replace_program
 * (replace_program.cc). Before this module the rule was inlined in four
 * C++ places -- the three callers plus filename_to_obname's own
 * strip-normalization loop -- with slightly different probe semantics (stat
 * vs access); testsuite/command/tests.c carries an LPC-layer copy that is
 * intentionally kept independent. This module owns the idempotent strip
 * (source_spelling_strip_len), the probe-and-fallback rule
 * (resolve_source_spelling) and the in-memory match (source_name_matches);
 * the callers keep their explicit-extension detection (load_object on the
 * raw pname, recompile on prog->filename).
 *
 * Semantics parameterized (callers differ):
 *  - requested_ext != nullptr: the caller knows the extension already, in
 *    dotted form (".lpc"/".c" -- an explicit request in load_object, or the
 *    compiled program's own filename in recompile_object). No probing
 *    unless allow_fallback.
 *  - allow_fallback: when the chosen .lpc source is missing, fall back to
 *    ".c" (probed with stat + S_ISDIR). load_object enables this only for
 *    extension-less names; recompile_object always enables it because a
 *    deleted .lpc source must degrade to the .c twin. Note the asymmetry:
 *    recompile_object previously probed with access(R_OK), which also
 *    accepts directories; stat + S_ISDIR rejects them (slightly stricter,
 *    by design). Also note load_object with an explicit ".lpc" never falls
 *    back while recompile always does for the same object -- recompile
 *    cannot know the request was explicit, a known trade-off.
 *
 * out_real_name receives path + selected ext truncated to out_size (always
 * NUL-terminated when out_size > 0).
